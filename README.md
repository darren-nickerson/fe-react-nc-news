# NC news 
A React front end project that I created as part of the Northcoders Bootcamp. The React website fetches data from an API that I designed. The website allows the user to filter, sort and upvote news articles. Also, post comments and upvote comments. <br />

## Install and Clone React Website:

- clone https://github.com/milcroft/fe-nc-news-version-1.git <br />
- npm install <br />
- npm run start <br />

## Live Hosted:
- React Website: https://nc-news-fc.onrender.com/ <br />
